            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Morter pieces brought up from <hi>Leith</hi> for the reducing of <hi>Sterling</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, the Enemy shot through and through our bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, but did not hurt any of our men, they plaid hard against our men that were in the steeple of the Town Kirk (which did much annoy them) they shot through the steeple, but in all their shot hurt but one man, 2. Morter pieces were drawn to the Platforms this evening. All things being in readinesse to go roundly to work with the Castle, the Lieut. Gen. sent a summons into the Castle, requiring the Governour to deliver the same to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115177:2"/> the use of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> to which he returned a verball answer, That he would keepe the Castle as long as he could, the Lieut. Gen. also sent about exchange of prisoners for some of ours he had in the Castle, but it seemes he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change none, in hopes to make terms by them.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Pinchbanck</hi> an Englishman, and one of the Colonels that Col. <hi>Blake</hi> gave pass to come from <hi>Scilly</hi> into <hi>Scotland,</hi> kist the Kings hand, went as far as <hi>Glasco</hi> with him towards <hi>England,</hi> but is come backe hither, declaring much disaffection and dissatisfaction to the enemies designe, and sayes he will not meddle any more with them.</p>
            <p>Wednesday the two Morter pieces were planted and <hi>Mr. Hean</hi> the Engineer which was sent from St. <hi>Iohnstons</hi> for that purpose, made two shots with each of them for triall, two of which fell and brake in the midst of the Castle.</p>
            <p>Thursday the 14 both Guns and Morter pieces plaid hard against the Castle, we made two of their Guns unserviceable, they hurt us two Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with small shot.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon whilst our Morter pieces were playing hard, they in the Castle beat a parley, which being harkned unto, they sent out a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with a letter containing desire of a treaty, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115177:3"/> Lieut. Gen. sent in a letter, wherein he took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Governors slighting his first summons, but proposed 3 Articles to him, which he would grant if he would render forthwith; hereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour after the Governor sent out Capt. <hi>Iames Cunningham</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Wright</hi> as Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners to Treat, but the Records of <hi>Scotland</hi> which the Governor desired might be conveyed to some other Garrison of theirs, being denied them, <hi>Mr. Wright</hi> said his commission was blown up, and would not Treat, so that by night the Articles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed were agreed and Hostages sent forth. The reason of their hasty surrender was from a mutiny of the Soldiers in the Castle, being a commanded party of theirs, and most Highlanders, and not accustomed to Granadoes were much affrighted, and beat the Drum without Order, threatning to throw over their Officers i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next day the Governour with about 300 Officers and Souldiers marched forth according to Agreement; the Souldiers had the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore broken open many of the Trunkes in the Castle, and went away with as much Geere as they could carry: There was in the Castle 40
